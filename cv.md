### A brief summary of myself

At the moment I am studying at the university, majoring in Chemical Engineering. 
But after the third year I realized that this direction is not close to me. 
This was the starting point for me to change the field of activity.

For half a year I've been studying with a tutor in Frontend Development. I also consolidated my knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript on the Sololearn platform. In addition, I regularly participate in online events from the HTML Academy, such as "Basics of Figma for coders", "Working with Git through the console" and others.

I study English on my own and on a course, including participating in conversation clubs and practicing the language.

In addition, 2 years was a tutor in chemistry for schoolchildren, I have the skill to teach. Therefore, I am able to communicate with people, convey their thoughts clearly.

I dream to participate in projects useful to society, ready to study additional technology stacks. I am open to work as a mentor.
